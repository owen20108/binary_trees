Trees represent a hierarchical structure where nodes are interconnected. A binary tree is a specific type of data structure where each node can have at most two children. The basic components of a binary tree include the root, path, and child nodes. The root is the topmost node, and there is only one root in a tree. A path is the sequence of nodes along the edges of the tree, and a child node is a node below a given node connected by an edge downward. Child nodes can be classified as either left or right children. In a Binary Search Tree (BST), the right child has a value greater than its parent node.

Key terms include:
- Root Node: The top node of the tree.
- Path: The sequence of nodes along the edges from the root to any other node.
- Child Node: A node below a given node, classified as left or right child.
- Parent Node: Any node, except the root, with one edge upward.
- Leaf Node: A node without any child nodes, located at the end of a binary tree.
- Subtree: The descendants of a node.
- Visiting: Examining the value of a node when control is on the node.
- Traversing: Moving through nodes in a specific order.

Basic operations in a Binary Search Tree (BST) include:
- Insert: Adding an element to the tree.
- Search: Locating an element in the tree.
- Preorder Traversal: Visiting the root node first, followed by the left subtree, and then the right subtree.
- Inorder Traversal: Visiting the left subtree first, then the root node, and finally the right subtree.
- Postorder Traversal: Visiting the left subtree first, then the right subtree, and finally the root.

For the insert operation, the element is placed based on its value in relation to the root node. If the value is less than the root, it goes to the left subtree; otherwise, it goes to the right subtree. The search operation involves starting from the root and navigating either the left or right subtree based on the value being searched.

In preorder traversal, the root node is visited first, followed by the left and right subtrees. In inorder traversal, the left subtree is visited first, followed by the root and then the right subtree. Postorder traversal involves visiting the left and right subtrees first, and then the root.
